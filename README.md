I am a JS focused developer.
If I do something, I'm doing it in JS or I'm not doing it, because I'm better in JS than aything else but most importantly because that's the language i love

# I'm currently working on multiple projects such as: 
- Dbs made easier, [Informa-Db.js](https://npmjs.com/package/informa-db.js), 
- My own website, [immweb](https://imm.now.sh/) and
- A regex-based conversion bot, [PityBitty](https://github.com/informathemusic/PityBitty)
